## What was done?

Created a function that hides the main page section and shows the form section.



## Why did you do it?

So the user can make a new, custom poster.



## How did you do it?

We query selected the approriate elements and stored them in a variable. We then established an event listener that was listening for a 
click on a specified button. This triggered a function that hid the main page section and made visible the form section. 




## Anything else to know?
